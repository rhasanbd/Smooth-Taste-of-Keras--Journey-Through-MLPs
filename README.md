If github in unable to render a Jupyter notebook, copy the link of the notebook and enter into the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

These notebooks provide a brief introduction to the use of Keras in the context of building simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). 

Following problems are addressed:
- How to build a simple MLP classifier? (Notebook 1)
- How to perform hyperparameter tuning? (Notebook 2)
- How to find optimal learning rate for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm used in training the MLP? (Notebook 3)
- How to build a simple Multi-output MLP classifier? (Notebook 4)


The notebooks are partially adapted from Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2nd Edition)".
