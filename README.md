These notebooks provide a brief introduction to the use of Keras in the context of building simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). 

Following problems are addressed:

- Notebook 1: How to build a simple MLP classifier using the **Sequential API**?
  
  -- Understand how to create ANN models using Keras
  
  -- Comparative understanding of 3 different Model APIs (Sequential, Functional, Subclassing)
  
  -- Add layers, perform input preprocessing, add and tune optimizers, etc.
  
  -- Visualize model architecture
  
  -- Visualize dynamic learning curves
  
  -- Save model checkpoints, early-stop training
  
  -- Different ways of evaluating the model


- Notebook 2: How to perform **hyperparameter tuning**? 

- Notebook 3: How to **find optimal learning rate** for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm used in training the MLP? 

- Notebook 4: How to build a simple Multi-output MLP classifier using **Functional API** and **Subclassing API**?


The notebooks are partially adapted from Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2nd Edition)".
